Planned for use at NRK 11.11.2015

#Agenda
- Classroom theory on why we are doing this
- Classroom theory on what fake is
- Hands-on playing with FAKE to get a feel for operators, targets, fsharp syntax at your desks or laptops in classroom. If we do pair-programming, let the driver be the one with the least fsharp experience.
- Classroom presentations of how we use FAKE and a look at TeamCity running FAKE
- Hands-on modifying real builds
- Discussion
- Contributing to FAKE

# Why are we doing this? (Classroom, presentation)
https://nrkbeta.no/2015/11/10/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-ci-server/
- Build locally
- Build branches
- Should be easy for anyone to change build definitions

# What is FAKE (Classroom, presentation)
http://forki.github.io/FAKE.Intro/#/

# Fake workshop - part 1 (On own machines)
Goal: Getting used to the syntax

A little F# could be useful, define things with let. 
Functions don't have paranthesis. 
You can also turn things around a bit with the |> operator for clarity.
That's it... I hope.
```
let add x = 1 + x
add 1
1 |> add
```

Use the machine and code from here (setup instructions in the README)
https://github.com/bjartwolf/Kebab/tree/xunit-2.10

```
git clone https://github.com/bjartwolf/Kebab
cd Kebab
git checkout xunit-2.10
cd Trees
build.cmd 
```
or on linux/mac
```
build.sh
```
and in PowerShell
```
.\build.cmd
```


If everything is green it works. Yay. Fake works, builds, install runners, tests and reports without Visual Studio. See how easy you make life for everyone else?

## Exercices
# Start fresh
Try to comment out everything after line 17 in Trees/build.fsx using 
``` 
(* 
   multiline commenting in F# 
*)
```

Running build.cmd now doesn't do that much anymore.

## Finding files 
FAKE has special trics for finding files, that could project files (cs.proj, fs.proj), packages.config or something else. 
We should play with the syntax a bit to get comfortable with how it works.
```
for ref in testReferences do tracefn "Found a file %s" ref
```

Or the little more fsharpy way of doing it
```
Seq.iter (fun f -> tracefn "Found a file %s" f) testReferences 
```

(Trace functions are documented here http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/apidocs/fake-tracehelper.html)

## Try changing the patterns
Try to print out all the files in the subdir

## Filtering and adding files
The special syntax ++ and -- can be added after files included with !!
to include more files or filter out files. Try it! Maybe even on C: to find files, it should/could work.

## A better way than iterating
The things we get from !! ++ -- are called FileIncludes, and can be iterated over as we saw earlier as a sequence of strings (IEnumerable<string>) and a lot of FAKE functions take these.

```
Log "found a file" testReferences 
```
Or the other way around - pass arguments with |>
```
testReferences |> Log "found a file"
```

## Targets
Now try to wrap your file-finding and logging  it up in proper targets and make a list of dependent targets (see how it is done in the already commented out code, define targets, define depedencies and define a default target)

# Real project things (Classroom, presentation)
## Show the builds we have
#Demonstration 
Show the backend and frontend scripts, the backend looks like this, but the rest is in our closed source control.

https://gist.github.com/bjartwolf/daafed892f2ee78be070

# Real project hacking (on own machines)
Look, not dangerous, make a branch and do something to the build. For exapmle add FSharp linting to the backend build.
Or log something to teamcity. Or just break the build by throwing an exception (failwith "oops"), check it in and see what happens on teamcity.

If you want to try something useful try this:

https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint

http://fsprojects.github.io//FAKE-Task.html

Or make a build definition from the not-migrated backend services.


# Team discussion/feedback
- So what do you think?
- Do you need to/want to learn more fsharp?
- Etc...
